SQL-Help:

You must create the following table with the EXACT name of the table and it's fields.
-----
Table name - basicinfo
Field names:
	fieldid INT/auto_increment/NOT NULL/PRIMARY KEY
	fname TEXT/NOT NULL
	sname TEXT/NOT NULL
	email TEXT/NOT NULL
-----

The following are some security measures:
	mysql_real_escape_string(VARIABLE) -  This prevents users from typing in MySQL queries in to a text field
	md5(VARIABLE) - One way encryption for security, very useful for passwords
	htmlspecialchars(VARIABLE) - Strips a string of all '<' and '>' to prevent users from adding HTML code to the DB
(NOTE: The VARIABLE should be replaced with an actual set variable e.g. "md5($fname);")
